# Jul (Dada fork)

**Jul** is a fork of "Acmlmboard 1.92", an *ancient* system designed by Acmlm (not me). This repository is mostly kept so that improvements and updates are possible by forum members, and to patch any possible vulnerabilities. The actual running code itself includes a few protections that are not in this repository, mostly to prevent and guard against automated attacks.

The code in this repository is quite old (most of it was written in 2001). There is no separation of concerns or MVC pattern, so it's difficult to make changes. There are no plans to significantly restructure the code, but some minor cleanup work has been done. Unsafe code, such as incorrect SQL escaping, has been replaced with modern equivalents.

This specific repository is the **Dada fork** of Jul, which has the following improvements over [the original](asdf):

* Includes an installer and default configuration
* Has most of the old, unused code removed
* Has all community-specific code removed
* Includes a converter for IPB 3.0 to Jul
* Allows setting a base path, so the install isn't forced to be on the domain root

Despite its age, Jul is tested and working with Unicode, including emoji. ðŸ™‚

## Installing

1. Copy the files to a directory served by e.g. Apache running PHP 7. (Using a lower version should be possible as well, but is untested.)

1. Copy `lib/config.example.php` to `lib/config.php` and add your database configuration.

1. Now run `install.php` from the browser. There's no need to remove the installer after you're done.

1. Your installation of Jul should now be ready and waiting with a single user account active: `admin` with password `admin`. You should change that right away.

## Code notes

The following globals are used:

* `$GLOBALS['jul_base_path']` â€“ base path, e.g. to put in front of `/css/base.css`
* `$GLOBALS['jul_views_path']` â€“ path to the views base directory (same as base path for now), e.g. for `thread.php`, etc.
* `$GLOBALS['jul_settings']` â€“ user configuration (with defaults) from `/lib/config.php`
* `$GLOBALS['jul_sql_settings']` â€“ database connection settings, also from `/lib/config.php`

These are available in Javascript on the `window` object as well.

Aside from removing old code, there are significant structural differences compared to the [original fork](https://github.com/Xkeeper0/jul) of Jul:

* Most files that were in the root are now in `/views/` â€” and they cannot be run independently anymore.
* Instead of running e.g. `thread.php` directly when viewing a thread, all routes go through `index.php` which loads the appropriate file based on the user's requested path.
* All files have been separated into two types: files that defined functions (`/lib/`) and files that send output (`/views/`).
* The config file has been moved to the root.
